# BasicGameNeuralNetworkTrainer
A trainer for the neural network using the genetic algorithm for a basic game.

This repo is to act as a smoke test for evolving a neural network created using [NeuralNetwork](https://github.com/jobeland/NeuralNetwork) and evolved using [GeneticAlgorithm](https://github.com/jobeland/GeneticAlgorithm)
